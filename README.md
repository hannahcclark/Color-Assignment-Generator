# Color-Assignment-Generator
Node.js module that will generate vibrant, unique, and visibly different (as much as can reasonably be expected based on number of colors generated) RGB colors for as long as possible

##How to Get It
Run ```npm install colorassignmentgenerator```

Include the following in your file:
<br>```var colorGen = require('colorassignmentgenerator')```

##How to Use It
To get new RGB color use the `getColor()` method. This will return a dictionary with keys `r`, `g`, and `b`, whose values are the corresponding RGB values.

If you are worried about loosing your place in color assignment if/when your application halts running, call the `getSavedValues()` method. This method returns a dictionary that you may save in a persistant store. 

When your program resumes running, simply pass the saved object to the `setSavedValues(savedDict)` method.
